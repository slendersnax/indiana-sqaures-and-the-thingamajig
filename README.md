# Indiana Squares and The Thingamajig

This is a project I did for a uni class a while back, I intend to work on it a bit and maybe expand on the idea (sometime).

### running the game

in the main folder use 
```
javac @sources -d out
cp -r data/ out/
```
to compile and to copy the 'data' folder into 'out', then
```
cd out/
java Main
```
to run the program
