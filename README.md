# Indiana Squares and The Thingamajig

This is a project I did for a uni class a while back, I intend to work on it a bit and maybe expand on the idea (sometime).

### running the game

For the first setup run the included `build-and-run.sh` file (on Linux). Afterwards you can just run the `run.sh` file.
